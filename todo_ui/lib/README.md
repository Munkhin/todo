Purpose of items in this directory:

- api: Typed API client and endpoint wrappers for tasks, scheduling, sync, and energy profiles.
- constants: Shared scheduling defaults and related constant values (e.g., energy levels, hours).
- store: Zustand state stores for tasks, settings, and source connections with persistence.
- utils.ts: Small UI helper to merge Tailwind/class names (`cn`).
